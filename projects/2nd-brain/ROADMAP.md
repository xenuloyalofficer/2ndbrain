## Now (This Week)

- [x] Create folder structure
- [x] Audit 5 of 7 projects (Flow Stach, Take It Down, Imacx, Jocril, DARVO)
- [x] Create active tracking (TODAY.md, THIS_WEEK.md, BLOCKED.md)
- [ ] Complete 2nd Brain self-audit (PROJECT_AUDIT.md)
- [ ] Populate knowledge base (tech-stack/, patterns/, workflows/)

---

## Next (This Month)

- [ ] Audit Scientology Archive (when documents become available)
- [ ] Create cross-project tech stack guides:
  - [ ] Next.js guide (used in 4 projects)
  - [ ] Convex guide (used in 3 projects)
  - [ ] Clerk guide (used in 3 projects)
  - [ ] Supabase guide (used in 1 project)
  - [ ] Gradio guide (used in 1 project)
- [ ] Document common patterns:
  - [ ] Auth patterns (Clerk, Supabase)
  - [ ] Clipboard patterns (Webflow JSON)
  - [ ] State management patterns
  - [ ] API integration patterns
- [ ] Create workflow guides:
  - [ ] Git workflow (branching, commits, PRs)
  - [ ] Deployment checklist (Vercel, manual)
  - [ ] Testing strategy (unit, E2E, integration)

---

## Later (This Quarter)

- [ ] Add decision logs to archive (major architectural decisions)
- [ ] Create project health dashboard (last commit, issues, tests passing)
- [ ] Add inter-project dependency mapping
- [ ] Create "Getting Started" guide for each project
- [ ] Add troubleshooting sections to PROJECT_AUDIT.md files
- [ ] Create visual architecture diagrams (optional)

---

## Ideas (Backlog)

- **AI Agent Workflows**: Document how to use 2nd Brain with different AI agents
- **Search Tool**: CLI or web interface to search across all projects
- **Automated Updates**: Script to detect repo changes and flag stale audits
- **Project Templates**: Cookiecutter templates based on tech stack patterns
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visualize relationships between projects, tech, patterns
- **Weekly Summaries**: Auto-generate weekly progress reports
- **Integration with GitHub**: Sync project status from GitHub APIs
- **AI-Generated Updates**: LLM reviews git commits and suggests CONTEXT.md updates

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- [ ] Update active/TODAY.md (daily)
- [ ] Review active/THIS_WEEK.md progress
- [ ] Update active/BLOCKED.md

### Monthly
- [ ] Review all ROADMAP.md files
- [ ] Archive completed audits
- [ ] Update tech stack guides if major version changes
- [ ] Check for stale documentation

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full project health check
- [ ] Review knowledge base coverage
- [ ] Update inter-project patterns
- [ ] Clean up archive folder

---

## Dependencies

### Scientology Archive Audit
- **Blocker**: Documents not yet available
- **Timeline**: Unknown
- **Impact**: 2nd Brain incomplete until audited

### Knowledge Base Population
- **Blocker**: Time/priority
- **Timeline**: This month
- **Impact**: Reduced cross-project learning efficiency

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Context Speed**: Clawbot can understand any project in < 5 minutes
2. **Cross-Project Reuse**: Patterns documented and reused across projects
3. **Maintenance Cost**: < 1 hour/week to keep 2nd Brain up-to-date
4. **Coverage**: All active projects have CONTEXT.md + ROADMAP.md + PROJECT_AUDIT.md
5. **Freshness**: No PROJECT_AUDIT.md older than 6 months
